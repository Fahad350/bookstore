          While you might pop into a bookstore looking for something specific,
          often a bookstore is a place to be and browse without a specific goal.
          This bookstore have a welcoming atmosphere. It has much more books
          which are friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. The bookstore is a
          place where community coalesces. Some small neighborhood stores are
          gathering places, and places to find information, be it about local
          events, real estate, or other local news.
